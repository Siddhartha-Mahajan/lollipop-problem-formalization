# Section S: 2-Connectivity and Rectangle Grids
## HOL Light: Section S (Lines 37553–39524)

This section develops the theory of 2-connected subgraphs of the grid:
- `segment_end`: a segment with two specified endpoints
- `conn`: edge sets such that any two closure points are joined by a sub-segment
- `conn2`: 2-connected edge sets (any segment can avoid a third point)
- `rectangle_grid`: rectangular grids of edges
- Key results: rectagons are conn2, rectangle grids are conn2, conn2 sets contain rectagons
