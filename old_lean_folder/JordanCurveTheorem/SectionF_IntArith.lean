# Section F: Integer Arithmetic, Closed Squares, Component Filling, and Reflections
## HOL Light: Section F (Lines 9413–12021)

This section covers:
- Integer absolute value (`num_abs_of_int`) — handled by `Int.natAbs` in Mathlib
- Grid navigation inverses (`right_left`)
- Closed unit squares (`squc`) and proof that `closure (squ p) = squc p`
- Edge adjacency of squares (`adj_edge`)
- Connected component filling: every component of `ctop G` contains a square,
  and every square in a component has a nearby edge of G
- Along-segment analysis (`along_seg`)
- Reflections (`reflAf`, `reflBf`, `reflCf`) and their homeomorphism properties
- `IMAGE2` (lifting a map to act on sets of sets)
- General homeomorphism lemmas (bijection, closedness preservation)

Key downstream definitions: `squc`, `adj_edge`, `along_seg`, `reflAf`, `reflBf`,
`reflCf`, `reflAi`, `reflBi`, `reflCi`, `IMAGE2`.
