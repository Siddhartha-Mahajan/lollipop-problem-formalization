# Section B: Cell Complex Topology
## HOL Light: Section B (Lines 2684–3553)

Basic topology of cell complexes and set operations on cells.
Establishes that edges and squares are open, computes closures of all
cell types, and proves that cells are locally connected via adjacency.

### Key HOL Light results
- `closure_h_edge`, `closure_v_edge`, `closure_squ`
- Open/closed set properties for cell types
- Boundary characterizations
