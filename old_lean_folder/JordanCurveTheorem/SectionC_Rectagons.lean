# Section C: Rectagons and Segments
## HOL Light: Section C (Lines 3554–4783)

The fundamental combinatorial curve objects on the integer grid: rectagons
(grid analogs of simple closed curves), segments (grid analogs of arcs),
and psegments (proper segments with exactly two endpoints).

### Key HOL Light definitions
- `rectagon` (~3562): Finite nonempty connected set of edges, every lattice
  point has 0 or 2 incident edges
- `segment` (~3570): Like rectagon but allows 0, 1, or 2 incident edges
- `psegment` (~3578): Segment that is not a rectagon (has exactly 2 endpoints)
- `endpoint` (~3591), `midpoint` (~3594): Lattice points with 1 or 2
  incident edges
- `other_end` (~4290): Given one endpoint of a psegment, the other endpoint
